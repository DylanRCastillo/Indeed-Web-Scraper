Data Analyst Junior  We are seeking a full-time Data Analyst Junior to join our team immediately. This position offers a highly interdisciplinary research experience, combining approaches from cognitive neuroscience, experimental psychology, psychiatry, and statistics with neuroimaging. The applicant will have the opportunity to participate in major methodological and analytic developments, publications, and presentations.  Responsibilities will include supporting principal investigators, fellows, and technical staff with in-depth analyses using multiple complex datasets. While the position is entry-level (i.e. recent college graduates are encouraged to apply!), the analyst will work closely with a PhD-level statistician/psychometrician to climb very steep learning curves quickly. The analyst will thereby acquire an unusually advanced skillset compared to most entry-level positions. For this reason, we are especially seeking applicants with long-term career goals in statistics or psychometrics.  Example tasks might include being asked to: 1. Determine the statistical effects of missing data and compare the results of some available imputation methods (maximum likelihood, random forest, etc.).  2. Determine the number of latent dimensions underlying a data set and apply factor analysis and item response theory to estimate model parameters for such uses as computerized adaptive testing and analysis of item bias.  3. Demonstrate (visually) a statistical effect in several different ways (e.g. using panels versus color-coding).  4. Link a list of physical street addresses to geocodes and link those geocodes to census data from multiple years.  5. Simulate item responses with other variables to determine how many Likert response categories are likely to be necessary on a personality scale with a specific number of items.  The applicant is not expected to be familiar with the above-s/he will be taught-but it is important that at least some of the above procedures seem interesting to the applicant.  Other duties might include: performing data management functions like extracting, importing, and exporting data from various in-house applications; restructuring and/or merging datasets; assisting with user documentation; running queries on datasets using SQL; preparing datasets for analyses; resolving data inconsistencies; and taking responsibility for completeness and quality of multiple data sets.  Qualifications  Bachelor's degree in Engineering, Physics, Statistics, Neuroscience or Experimental Psychology and 0-1 year of experience or equivalent combination of education and experience required.
